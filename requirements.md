# Zombie Survival Game Requirements

## Premise
You are a player in a world infested with zombies. Your goal is to survive as long as possible.

### Player
- Can move around a limited-sized map (approximately 5 minutes to explore)
- Moves faster than zombies
- Has health that decreases when attacked
- Can pick up weapons found throughout the map

### Zombies
- Move slowly toward the player
- Perform melee attacks that cause small damage
- Can attack in groups, causing significant damage
- Simple AI that follows the player

### Map/Environment
- Limited size but large enough for exploration
- Contains random objects (trees, obstacles)
- Weapons scattered throughout

### Weapons
- Melee: Simple bat for close combat
- Ranged: Pistol with unlimited ammo

### Perspective
- Third-person view (not FPS)
- Camera from slightly elevated position (similar to classic Pok√©mon games)
- Top-down or isometric-like perspective

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Single HTML file implementation

### Implementation Guidelines
- Single player only (no multiplayer functionality)
- Browser-based (no server requirements)
- Minimal code approach for MVP
- No external dependencies beyond Three.js

## Game Components Breakdown

### Player
- Controllable via keyboard input
- 3D model representation
- Health tracking
- Weapon inventory system

### Zombies
- Position tracking in 3D world
- Movement AI toward player
- Attack mechanics
- Health system

### Environment
- Ground plane
- Static objects (trees)
- Defined boundaries

### Weapons
- Pickup mechanics
- Different attack patterns
- Visual representations

### Camera
- Follows player movement
- Fixed angle (elevated view)

### User Interface
- Health indicator
- Start/Restart game button
- Game over screen

### Game Logic
- Movement systems
- Collision detection
- Combat mechanics
- Game over conditions

### Creation Functions

#### `createPlayer()`
- Creates player's 3D model
- Sets initial position and properties
- Adds player to the scene
- Returns the player object

#### `createZombie(position)`
- Creates a zombie 3D model
- Sets position (random if not specified)

#### `updatePlayer()`
- Updates player position based on keyboard input
- Handles player movement constraints within map boundaries
- Updates camera position to follow player
- Returns updated player position

#### `updateZombies()`
- Updates all zombies' positions
